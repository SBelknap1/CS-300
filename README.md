## Reflection – Advising Assistance Program (Project Two)

In this project, the problem I was solving was how to store, organize, and retrieve course information efficiently for advising purposes. The program needed to load course data from a file, display all courses in alphanumeric order, and allow users to search for a specific course and its prerequisites.  

I approached the problem by implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store the courses. Data structures like BSTs are important because they allow fast searching, insertion, and ordered traversal, which directly supports the program’s requirements.  

One roadblock I encountered was ensuring that the input parsing and tree insertion handled edge cases correctly, such as missing prerequisites or malformed lines in the CSV file. I overcame this by writing a tokenizer function and validating input before inserting courses into the tree.  

This project expanded my approach to software design by showing me how to connect abstract data structures to real-world problems. It also reinforced the importance of testing each feature incrementally to confirm functionality before moving on.  

My work on this project has evolved the way I write programs by making me more disciplined about structure, readability, and adaptability. I used clear function separation, comments, and consistent naming so the code is easier to maintain and extend in the future. Overall, this project demonstrated my ability to apply data structures and algorithms in a practical, user-focused application.
